# PulseSpigot
A 1.8 fork of PaperSpigot which aims to optimize, give long term support for 1.8.9 and add useful apis, 

**The most up to date, optimized 1.8.9 on the market**

## Features
Since 1.8 is ~8 years old now, it has missed out on a lot of critial fixes, updates and optimizations,
So we plan on offering those much needed updates to 1.8!
By the end, we plan to support Java 23, Netty 4.1+, allow higher player counts and still support a large number of plugins
