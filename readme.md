# PulseSpigot  
A 1.8 fork of PaperSpigot that aims to optimize performance, provide long-term support for 1.8.9, and introduce useful APIs.  

## Features  
Since 1.8 is now over eight years old, it has missed out on many critical fixes, updates, and optimizations.  
Our goal is to bring these much-needed improvements to 1.8!  

By the end, we aim to:  
- Support Java 23  
- Use Netty 4.1+  
- Allow higher player counts  
- Maintain compatibility with a large number of plugins  

## Credits  
- **Nate** – Original author and primary contributor, with the most valuable code contributions to the project. Huge credit goes to him.  
- **Heath Logan Campbell** – Various NMS optimizations.  
- **IonSpigot** – Lag-compensated ticking, movement caching, and flushing.  
- **Albert** – Configurable pearls.  
- **P3ridot** – Most of the NMS optimizations.  
- **uRyanxD (PandaSpigot)** – Backported the modern tick loop from 1.13+.  

If I missed anyone, credit goes to them as well.  

**Note**: If you decide to use the code from this spigot then credits should be given, otherwise it'll count as skidding.

It's been a great journey. I enjoyed working on spigot, but sometimes, you just have to move on.
